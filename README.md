This project contains many examples of how Java Lambda expressions can be combined with Streams to process data sets using a functional programming style. The benefit of this style is that many transformations/operations can be performed on a data set using code that is fairly compact. Java functional programming also lends itself to parallel processing in order to take advantage of the multiple cores that are available on a typical server. List.of() is used throughout and requires Java 9 or later to run.
